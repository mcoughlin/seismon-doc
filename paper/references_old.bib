abstract = {
The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be located on the seismically active Chilean mountain of Cerro
Pachón. The accelerations resulting from seismic events produce the most demanding load cases the telescope and its
components must withstand. Seismic ground accelerations were applied to a comprehensive finite element analysis
(FEA) model which included the telescope, its pier and the mountain top. Response accelerations for specific critical
components (camera and secondary mirror assembly) on the telescope were determined by applying seismic
accelerations in the form of Power Spectral Densities (PSD) to the FEA model. The PSDs were chosen based on the
components design lives. Survival level accelerations were determined utilizing PSDs for seismic events with return
periods 10 times the telescope's design life which is equivalent to a 10% chance of occurring over the lifetime. Since the
telescope has a design life of 30 years it was analyzed for a return period of 300 years. Operational level seismic
accelerations were determined using return periods of 5 times the lifetimes. Since the seismic accelerations provided by
the Chilean design codes were provided in the form of Peak Spectral Accelerations (PSA), a method to convert between
the two forms was developed. The accelerations are also affected by damping level. The LSST incorporates added
damping to meets its rapid slew and settle requirements. This added damping also reduces the components' seismic
accelerations. The analysis was repeated for the telescope horizon and zenith pointing. Closed form solutions were
utilized to verify the results.

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will be located on a seismically active Chilean mountain. Seismic ground

accelerations is required. These seismic accelerations, in the form of Peak Spectral Acceleration (PSA), were compared
for site specific surveys, the Chilean building codes and measured seismic accelerations. Methods were also investigated
for adjusting for variations in damping level and return period. The return period is the average interval of time between
occurrences of a specific intensity.
